# Talk More, Code Less
A talking point for an upcoming discussion. The chosen title is also an interesting talking point, stemming from my belief that 'coding' is only a small part of software development.

As this exercise was time boxed, the focus on was achieving functionality whilst demonstrating certain techniques, relying upon further example code to demonstrate more advanced approaches.

This is NOT production ready code and I would not recommend writing code in this way for a live product.

Please note that I am a back end developer and usualy only turn my hand to altering existing frotn end code. For this reason, I was unable to attempt the front end task as learning an appropriate framework would have taken a large amoutn of time. Instead, I plan to demonstrate a Web Assembly created using a technology that I have been recently studying using the [Uno Platform](https://platform.uno/), creating the front end with [UWP XAML](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/).

Certain common techniques are not present in this example code and for this reason I invite the reader to visit my other repositories, in particular the following:

## Guts - Example Web Architecture
A demonstration WebAPI I created late last year to demonstrate certain techniques that increased code re-use, a separation of concerns with loose coupling and a simple WebAPI client for accessing a 3rd party.
This is based upon an architecture I've developed over the last few years and used on several projects.

# Other Coding Projects
I enjoy IoT as a hobby and have been sharing my code as open source on GitHub while also sharing these projects on instagram. This hobby blends my earlier exprience in electronics with my passion for code.
